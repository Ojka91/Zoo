2-Start a new day. Every day an animal has a probability to lose a friend, and to make new friend. 
At the beggining animals doesn't know each other very well, so the % to lose a friend is high (60%) and
to make a new friend is low (only 20%). Overtime it changes until 30% to lose a friend and 50% to make a new friend.
